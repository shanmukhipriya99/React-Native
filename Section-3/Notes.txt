1) <Flatlist> takes in two parameters: 
        the array of data
        renderItem (like map() in react)
2) Keys are important while using lists:
   If keys were not present and even if a single element is deleted, then all the elements are deleted and the remaining elements are then displayed again
   If keys are present, only the deleted element will disappear.
   Used for performance optimization
   Should be a string and unique
