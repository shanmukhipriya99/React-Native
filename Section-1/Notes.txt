1) Component files create and export exactly one React Component
2) Part-1: Import libraries we need to create a Component
3) Part-2: Create a Component- a function that returns some 'JSX'
4) Part-3: Create a stylesheet to style our Component
5) Part-4: Export the Component so we can use it elsewhere in the project
6) React library: how different Components act together
7) React Native library: knows how to take information from the Components and use it to actually show some content on the mobile device
8) We cannot display a Js object inside a <Text> element!!!
    ex: const greeting = { color: 'red' }
        return <Text> {greeting} </Text>
        this will give an error
